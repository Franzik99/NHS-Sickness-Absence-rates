#NHS-Sickness-Absence-Rates
##Background
This project analyses and forecasts NHS workforce sickness absence trends using official NHS Digital data. The objective is to understand long-term patterns, 
seasonality, and structural changes in absence rates, and to build predictive insights that can support workforce planning and cost optimisation. 
Using historical monthly data from 2009–2025, the project applies data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression modelling, and time-series techniques to 
separate trend, seasonality, and residual components. The results demonstrate clear seasonal effects and a sustained increase in sickness absence following 
the COVID-19 period, highlighting the importance of data-driven workforce forecasting.
